## Installation

This section provides step-by-step instructions to set up the web API server, including creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and configuring the database.

1. Please ensure to download the latest [Python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
2. Install [Terminal for Windows](https://medium.com/@bonguides25/how-to-install-and-update-windows-terminal-in-windows-10-11-b85361b1aa07#:~:text=The%20first%20and%20easiest%20way,minutes%20to%20download%20and%20install.), or [Terminal for Mac](https://medium.com/@latusikl/the-ultimate-setup-for-macos-terminal-7fd340f58366) is another terminal that can be used to run the application
3. Optional download: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) is another terminal that can be used to run the application  
4. Download [Insomia](https://insomnia.rest/download) for testing API  
5. Clone from repository to local machine with the following command in terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TilleyCodes/web_api_server_assessment
```
6. **Virtual Environment Set Up:** Dependent packages are installed through the terminal virtual environment for dependency isolation and system python protection.  

    i. enter virtual environment 
```bash
    python -m venv env
```  
- once the the program has run you will see a folder named .venv     
   
    iia. activate environment for macOS/Linux 
```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
```  

or,  

    iib. activate environment for windows input:  
```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- this will activate virtual environment. You can then run the pip install command for the corresponding packages per below.    

    iii. deactivate virtual environment  
```bash
    deactivate
```  
- this will exit out of the virtual environment   

7. Install the dependent packages as listed in requirements.txt in bulk with the following command or skip this step if you prefer to install the packages separately - follow the commands under packages:  
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Packages

Installation for the following packages are required for the web API server to run successfully. Steps 5.i-iib under Installation must be completed before running the pip install command below.

## Set Up

### PostgreSQL  

1. Run the following command in terminal to enter into the postrgreSQL repl environment:  
```bash
    psql
```    

2. Create a database:
```sql
   CREATE DATABASE web_api_db;
```     

3. Create a user and password (choose you own user and password):
```sql
    CREATE USER <user_name> WITH PASSWORD <'******'>;
```    

4. Grant permission to interact with the database (replace user_name with the name created in step 3): 
```sql
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE web_api_db TO <user_name>;
```  

5. Create .env file and add to DATABASE_URI with the following (replace user name and password per set up):
```bash
    DATABASE_URI=postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:<port_number>/web_api_db
```
  
### zsh  

Run the following command in a new terminal to create and seed the tables before starting the development server:    

1. Create the tables:  
```bash
    flask db create
```  

2. Seed the tables:
```bash
    flask db seed
``` 

3. Drop the tables: 
```bash
    flask db drop
```     

**Note:** If you do drop the tables, ensure to re-create and seed the tables again.  

4. Start the development server:  
```bash
    flask run
```     

---  

## Deployment    

The API was deployed using Render: [https://tilley-investment-portfolio-web-api.onrender.com]   

Example: Create a stock.

## Testing    

Insomia will be used to test the CRUD operations on all entities for the Investment Portfolio Managemnt WEB API. Using the default http://localhost:5000 as the base URL.         
Follow step 4 in [Installation](#installation) if Insomia is not yet downloaded.    

Note: If the database is hosted on Neon, update the `DATABASE_URI` in the `.env` file accordingly. Also Gunicorn default URL localhost port number is 8000 eg. http://localhost:8000  
Start the development server using gunicorn:   
```bash
    gunicorn 'main:create_app()'
```

## Database System

### Why PostgreSQL is the chosen database for this web API:  

- PostgreSQL is a reliable, enterprise-grade relational database.
- It enforces data consistency and integrity, crucial for financial applications.
- PostgreSQL has advanced SQL capabilities for complex querying and analytics.
- It can handle large data volumes and high user concurrency, providing scalability.
- The extensible ecosystem allows adding specialised features as needed.
- PostgreSQL's relational model aligns well with the structured financial data.
- Compared to NoSQL databases, PostgreSQL is a better fit for this application.
- Overall, PostgreSQL provides the necessary data integrity, querying power, scalability, and extensibility for this investment portfolio management API.  

### PostgreSQL (RDBMS) vs MongoDB (NoSQL Database)

- Data Structure:    
    - PostgreSQL organises data in structured tables with predefined schemas.  
    - MongoDB uses a schema-less model, storing data in document-oriented JSON-like BSON objects.    

- Data Integrity:  
    - PostgreSQL enforces data consistency through strict schemas, primary keys, and foreign keys.  
    - MongoDB trades data integrity for flexibility, allowing loosely defined data structures but risking inconsistency.    
 
- Querying:    
    - PostgreSQL excels at complex queries involving multiple tables and joins.    
    - MongoDB performs well with simple queries and high-speed data retrieval but lacks the querying power of SQL.    

- Flexibility:  
    - PostgreSQL supports structured and semi-structured data (via JSONB), but requires schema changes for major structural adjustments.  
    - MongoDB‚Äôs schema-less nature allows for dynamic changes, making it better suited for applications with rapidly evolving data models.
