**Date of feedback:** 04/12/2024     
**Feedback Provided:**     
- In the CurrencyConverter class, it might be usfule to add some extra error messages for cases like invalide currency codes, so users can understand what went wrong.  
- Possibly include a section in the ReadMe that touches on any ethic considerations, like how the app ensures fair exchange rates and how it handles user's data.  
- Code comments - module level docstrings and clarity on classes.

**Actions to be complete based on feedback:**    
- It would be helpful to add some user-friendly error messsages in the CurrencyConverter class for errors such as unrecognised currencies. 
- Maybe prompt users to try again if they make a mistake.  
- A small section in the ReadMe about ethical considerations would be great addition, letting users know how you ensure the exchange rates are fair and how you handle any date privacy.  
- Review of code comments

**My notes and plan of action based on feedback:**  
- Error messages for incorrect currency code input are captured in currency_converter_functions.py: - no action  
- The application captures real-time exchange rate base on the market using APi key from http://api.exchangeratesapi.io.: - updated in ReadMe with a link to license & service agreement   
- Review code comments: - reviewed and updated to include code examples
