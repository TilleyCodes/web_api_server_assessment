You have duplicated the same command to seed and drop the tables. Update the command for drop table 

**My notes and plan of action based on feedback:**  
- Corrected the duplicate code command. Went through all of ReadMe throughly to triple check for any spelling mistakes and duplicate code comments.

Strengths:

Separation of Concerns: Using an app factory function (create_app) promotes modularity and testability.

Environment Variable Usage: Utilising os.environ.get("DATABASE_URI") makes the configuration flexible and suitable for different environments.

Blueprint Registration: Clearly registering blueprints for different parts of your application is an excellent approach for organising your codebase.

Areas For Improvement:

Add docstrings to describe the purpose of the module and functions.

Other than that I can't find anything else It's really good

**My notes and plan of action based on feedback:**  
- Went through all Controllers, Enums, Models, Schemas and Main and added docstring comments for all modules, classes and functions
